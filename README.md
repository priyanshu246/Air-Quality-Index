Overview
This project aims to provide insights into air quality by calculating and displaying the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on various pollutant concentrations. Understanding AQI is crucial for public health, environmental monitoring, and urban planning. Depending on the project's scope, it might involve real-time data acquisition, historical data analysis, predictive modeling, or visualization of air quality trends.

The AQI is a standardized measure that translates pollutant concentrations into a single, easy-to-understand number, along with a corresponding color and descriptive category, to indicate air quality levels and associated health concerns.

Features
AQI Calculation: Implements the official AQI calculation methodology (e.g., EPA standards, local environmental agency guidelines) based on pollutant concentrations (PM2.5, PM10, O3, CO, SO2, NO2, etc.).

Real-time Data Fetching (if applicable): Integrates with external APIs or sensors to retrieve current pollutant data.

Historical Data Storage & Analysis (if applicable): Stores historical air quality data for trend analysis and research.

Data Visualization: Presents AQI and pollutant levels through intuitive charts and graphs (e.g., line charts, bar charts, heatmaps).

Location-based Information (if applicable): Allows users to view AQI for specific geographical locations.

Health Recommendations: Provides health advisories corresponding to different AQI levels.

User-friendly Interface: (For web/mobile applications) An intuitive dashboard or mobile app to display air quality information.

Predictive Modeling (if applicable): Utilizes machine learning models to forecast future AQI levels.
